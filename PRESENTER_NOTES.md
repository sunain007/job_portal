## Common Questions & Answers

### Q: "Can users upload custom resumes?"
**A:** "In the prototype, this is simulated with placeholder resumes. In the full implementation, users will be able to upload PDF, Word, and other document formats. We can also implement resume parsing to automatically extract information and populate profile fields."

### Q: "How will payments work for job postings?"
**A:** "We'll integrate a payment system like Stripe for employers to purchase job posting credits or subscriptions. Different tiers can offer features like promoted listings, extended visibility, or access to premium candidate tools."

### Q: "What about email notifications?"
**A:** "The full platform will include comprehensive email notifications - application confirmations for candidates, applicant alerts for employers, interview reminders, and status updates. All emails will match the platform's branding."

### Q: "Can this work on mobile?"
**A:** "Absolutely. The entire prototype is fully responsive. Let me show you..." (Resize browser or show on mobile device)

### Q: "How do you prevent spam applications?"
**A:** "In production, we'll implement verification systems, rate limiting, and quality checks. Employers can also set application requirements like minimum years of experience or required skills."

### Q: "What about candidate screening?"
**A:** "We can add advanced features like resume parsing, keyword matching, AI-powered candidate ranking, and pre-screening questions. Employers can set automatic filters to prioritize the most relevant candidates."

---

## Technical Questions

### Q: "What's the tech stack?"
**A:** "This prototype is built with React and TypeScript for type safety, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Vite as the build tool. For production, we'd add a backend API (Node.js or similar), a database (PostgreSQL), authentication system, and cloud hosting."

### Q: "How long to build the full platform?"
**A:** "Based on the feature set demonstrated, we estimate 12-16 weeks for an MVP with core functionality. This includes backend development, authentication, payment integration, and thorough testing. We can provide a detailed project timeline."

### Q: "What about scalability?"
**A:** "The architecture we'll use is designed for scale - cloud hosting with auto-scaling, CDN for assets, optimized database queries, and caching strategies. The platform can easily handle thousands of concurrent users."

---

## Closing Statement (1 min)

"This prototype demonstrates the core user experience and visual design of the Job Portal platform. In the full implementation, all of this will be backed by a robust backend system with real authentication, data persistence, payment processing, email notifications, and advanced features like resume parsing and candidate matching.

The design system we've shown is fully documented and ready for development. We have comprehensive component libraries, style guides, and technical specifications prepared.

What would you like to explore further? Do you have any questions about specific features or functionality?"
