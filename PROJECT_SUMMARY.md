## How to Use This Prototype

### For Client Presentation
1. Follow the **PRESENTER_NOTES.md** for a structured demo
2. Start with the job seeker flow, then show employer features
3. Highlight responsive design by resizing browser
4. Use role switcher to toggle between experiences
5. Emphasize interactive elements and micro-interactions

### For Development Handoff
1. Review **STYLE_GUIDE.md** for design specifications
2. Examine component structure in `/src/components`
3. Reference mock data structure in `/src/data/mockData.ts`
4. Use as visual reference for backend implementation
5. Maintain design consistency when adding features

### For Stakeholder Review
1. Share the deployed prototype link or ZIP file
2. Provide **README.md** for context
3. Encourage hands-on exploration of both roles
4. Gather feedback on flows, design, and features
5. Use **DELIVERABLES_CHECKLIST.md** to track feedback

## Limitations (By Design)

This is a **front-end prototype only**. The following are intentionally not implemented:

❌ No backend API or database
❌ No real authentication or user accounts
❌ No data persistence (state resets on refresh)
❌ No actual file uploads
❌ No email notifications
❌ No payment processing
❌ No advanced search algorithms
❌ No resume parsing

These features are documented in the README as "Next Steps for Development."
